# Studying DevEx BI :books:

This is an example of business inteligence using the DevEx library, with a PostgreSQL database implemented.<br>
The project is not ready for use, but if you want to try creating your own localdb, and explore this project to use it, be free.

The settings to configure your own DB is present on the 'Interfaces' folder, there is a unique file there. <br>
DevEx it's paid:dollar:, but has a trial test if you want to give a try.
